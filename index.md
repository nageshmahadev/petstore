Often, it is handy to have an N-Tiered Azure architected deployment ready to go, complete with functional code, CI/CD and various services for you to experiment with. Since it is usually hard to find one that hits many of the App Dev Services of Azure, I've decided to build one. Perhaps you're learning new technologies, giving demos, looking for a prototype or simply just curious, these guides will get you on your way to running a full Hypothetical Azure Pet Store Application & Dependencies, using the Azure technologies illustrated below. Already built are two applications that we will be deploying to Azure App Service (petstoreapp) and Azure Kubernetes Service (petstoreservice). View to learn more!
